    There are two norms in visually exploring data 
    in the form of charts and graphs: finding patterns and trends within the data and observing the deviations from the patterns.
    In addition to these norms, there are also some exceptions. One of these exceptions is the concept of outliers. Both of these are important because they determine the visual appearance of a data set.
</p>
<p>
   The norms of a data set include the measures of central tendency such as mode, median, and mean. Because the measures of central tendency don't fully summarize the whole data set, we must use tools like the range of the data in order to get a real shape of the data distribution. 
</p>
<p>
   The outliers of a data set can negatively influence all of the normal characteristics by changing the calculations of the norms. Outliers are hurtful to data sets because they cause discrepancies within the set. These outliers can prove to be problematic by altering the visual attributes of the data set. All in all, data sets visualize the measures of central tendency well, but are hurt by the presence of outliers within the set.
